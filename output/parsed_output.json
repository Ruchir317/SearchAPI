While some early presidential series coins in 2007 lacked the inscription due to a minting error, all coins in the presidential series since 2009 have had \"In God We Trust\" inscribed on the front. These \"Godless dollars\" are rare errors that are sought after by collectors.",
    "reasoning": "The claim is based on a misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the facts. The absence of \"In God We Trust\" on some dollar coins was due to a minting error in 2007, not an intentional removal. The U.S. Mint continues to produce dollar coins with the inscription, and the error coins are considered rare and valuable.",
