🤦‍♂️🤦在新闻报道部分做出不当推论。赫芬顿邮报指，The National Pulse发表阴谋论文章（原文：He did this again on Wednesday, retweeting an article published by the right-wing website The National Pulse about how Trump may appear to win by a landslide on Election Day because mail-in votes won’t all have been counted yet.）。总体部分：控制者该媒体的总编是Raheem

2]。2018年，该人曾尝试编辑自己的英文维基百科条目，随后被其他编者发现违反了维基百科的规则[19]。敝人顺其自然，如果没有共识，敝人不会强求。请问方针是否有说证明一家媒体可靠的方式是证明其声誉良好？请问第一篇哪里有说声誉不佳？第二篇缺乏《国家脉动》的报导连结。第三篇并没有说《国家脉动》报导不准确，请仔细阅读。第四篇没有提到《国家脉动》的报导，只是推测性地引用了Raheem

website）[12]，但由于CNN在关于川普的录音事件中被许多可靠媒体描述为偏颇[13]，所以敝人认为CNN的描述不宜采用。总体而言，《国家脉动》大都被描述为保守媒体。而维基百科是允许保守媒体的，因此敝人觉得《国家脉动》没有问题。--Matt
