        "summary": "Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote to block the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.\nLast April, the Treasury Department placed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, as well as a dozen companies the oligarchs either owned or controlled.\nAmong the dozen sanctioned companies were three that were connected to Deripaska, who the Treasury Department referred to as \"a Kremlin insider.\"\nThat seems to undercut Senate Democrats’ suggestion that sanctions-relief is a sign of undue coziness between team Trump and Russian oligarchs.\nIn other words, it’s more likely a case of clumsiness, rather coziness with Russian oligarchs — as Senate Democrats suggest."

Kamala Harris has flourished online since Joe Biden selected her as running mate.\nIf she had been charged with a crime or convicted, the state bar would have been notified.\nAll that said, even if Harris had been convicted of a felony at some point, this would not prevent her from becoming vice president or assuming the presidency.\nHarris meets these requirements and is eligible to be president or vice president."
