website）[12]，但由於CNN在關於川普的錄音事件中被許多可靠媒體描述為偏頗[13]，所以敝人認為CNN的描述不宜採用。總體而言，《國家脈動》大都被描述為保守媒體。而維基百科是允許保守媒體的，因此敝人覺得《國家脈動》沒有問題。--Matt Smith（留言）很高興看到您終於承擔了舉證責任：首先，很明顯您舉出的這三則例子或多或少的都有標題黨的嫌疑，您此前指責稱CNN等所謂「左媒」「行文不妥」，但此時卻對National Pulse行文上要求甚低（第一條新聞翻譯成漢語：「震驚！亞利桑那州參議院……」，第二條新聞：「拜登撒下2000美刀後……震驚！」，第三條新聞：「拜登上台的第十二天：只能提問審核過的問題！」）。其次，您這三則消息都是試圖證明該媒體可靠，而非反駁我上方的舉證，也就是說您目前沒有找到能反駁我上方其他可靠來源的相反證據。好了，現在既然您舉證了，我們一句一句看您選出的這三則新聞。關於評價部分：紐約時報：「右翼出版物The national Pulse加入到了陰謀論之中」、Polygraph之前也認為該報是陰謀論者的基礎，您也沒有具體論證為什麼CNN在上一次事件中的不可靠會導致本次不可靠。綜上，應維持不可靠，但在觀點顯著時可以引用。--ときさき くるみ not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\n此外，Wikipedia:共識#什麼是共識指：「共識不強求一致同意。理想情況下，共識不會存在任何反對意見；但假如無法實現這點，共識應採納多數人的意見，並和重要少數的意見作出適當妥協。重大修改更應獲得絕大多數的同意」，目前討論中多數人的意見為不可靠，部分編者認為可能需要加入黑名單，您自己也承認了在您心目中可能能到第三級。此外，根據Wikipedia:可靠來源/布告板/評級指引#討論時間，目前討論已經超過7天。因此，我認為應當按照當前共識以第二級結案。--ときさき

[開玩笑的]再多討論也證明不了《環球時報》是不可靠來源，就如再多討論大家也不會將BBC、NYT視為不可靠來源。「由於新聞採編人員受到其出身和生活環境的制約，以及專業背景、工作經歷的影響，他們對於客觀的認知已經扭曲了。」這一觀點由來已久，至少1978年的《統理BBC》（《 A Seamless Robe》）就有提及（P129）。--MINQI（留言）@BlackShadowG： 2019年全疆機采率為53.91% ，而之前烏魯木齊晚報 2019年的是42% ，新華社也稱2019年有望突破40%，同一年份差別已經超過10%，不能視為誤差偏差， 二者數據中至少有一個是錯誤的 。其次，即使樓上給出的數據，也指出 南疆地區2020年的機采率為34.7% ，和環球時報所稱的全疆實現「 高度機械化 」也相去甚遠，稱「34.7%」為「高度機械化」不算造假？這還是僅依靠官方內部數據得出的結果，中共政權的官方數據有多不可靠，以前的見《人民日報》的 畝產萬斤 報道（《環球時報》為其子刊，《人民日報》從未就畝產萬斤發表更正和道歉），近期的見 李克強指數 ，2016年至2019年年均增幅為7%，然後2020年在疫情的影響下增幅卻一下子達到了28%，我覺得任何一個有點常識的人都能看出問題吧。綜上，我的結論就是《環球時報》是一家有造假前科和深刻造假背景的媒體，可信度極低，引用其數據會降低維基百科條目質量。--Aronlee90（留言） (：) 回應 (！) 抗議 ：烏魯木齊晚報寫的是突破1150萬畝當然寫42%以上，難不成寫50%以上？你不很會做算數用目前僅有數據麼？怎麼現在不用了？ 2020全疆69.83%、南疆部分地區34.7%；整體機采率或將達到60%以上、北疆95%。 Aronlee90閣下 再一次 在胡說八道甚至 無視已給數據

        "summary": "摘要陶傑在電台節目中引述前美國國家安全局官員賓尼的說法，後者聲稱以一組簡單數字可以說明美國大選出現舞弊。賓尼混淆了《華盛頓郵報》計算投票率的方法，從而得到錯誤的總票數（1.4億），並以此錯誤推論「拜登得票應少於特朗普」，陶傑另外引述的網站亦犯下相同錯誤。有學者整理了美國各州官方選舉數據，今次大選總票數應為1.58億左右。陶傑講述的「美國選舉作弊疑雲」實際上是錯誤使用投票計所得出的錯誤結論。背景2020年12月25日，時事評論人陶傑於《商業電台》頻道「雷霆881」的DJ專欄《評天下》引述前美國國家安全局官員賓尼（William Binney）的說法，後者聲稱以一組簡單數字可以說明2020年美國總選舉出現舞弊。[1]陶傑引述賓尼的說法指美國全國有約2.12億註冊選民，並指《華盛頓郵報》（The Washington Post）的數據顯示今屆美國大選投票率為66.2%，所以應有約1.4億選民投票。根據報導，特朗普（Donald Trump，陶傑在專欄中譯作「川普」）得到約7,400萬票，拜登（Joe Biden）最多只能到得到餘下6,600萬票。陶傑又稱一個叫「網關專家」（未有提及英文名稱）的網站整理數據，跟賓尼的發現接近，指拜登有多達1,300萬票重複點算。陶傑於專欄最後表示︰重複嘅計咗畀邊個呢？當然唔會計畀Donald Trump啦，所以呢條數係好簡單，唔需要話咩電腦軟件、數學計算、統計學常識，一千三百萬選票肯定呢就係假嘅，如果《華盛頓郵報》同埋美國家情報官嘅專業權威不容質疑嘅話，所以難怪而家嘅川普總統死人都唔會放棄。查證陶傑指賓尼在Twitter堅持美國大選有作弊，應是指賓尼於12月19日的Twitter帖文[2]，該帖文內容跟陶傑專欄的說法接近︰圖1︰賓尼帖文截圖賓尼引述的選民數字（2.12億）及投票率（66.2%）分別來自網站「World Population Review」的整理[3]以及《華盛頓郵報》報導。[4]「World Population Review」整理了各州的選民登記人數、人口總數、選民數字更新日期，並附上各州官方網站作為資料來源。根據該網站列出的數據，美國50州的選民登記人數總數為213,799,467人，即近2.14億。[5]由於部分州份的選民數字更新日期較早，例如蒙大拿（Montana）、北達高他（North Dakota）及德州所列資料為今年3月的選民數字，大選前的整體選民數字應該更高——蒙大拿選民人數由3月時的696,292增至大選時的752,538[6]、德州選民人數則由3月的16,211,198增至大選時的16,955,519[7]（北達高他為唯一不用登記成為選民的州份[8]，故屬例外）。至於《華盛頓郵報》關於投票率的報導，12月18日更新的版本顯示數字為66.2%，12月28日則更新為66.3%。圖2︰《華盛頓郵報》報導截圖不過投票率有不同計算方法，分別為「投票人數佔整體選民比例」或「投票人數佔具選民資格人口比例」。在美國，並非所有具投票資格的公民均自動成為選民，所以兩個數字並不一樣，而《華盛頓郵報》的報導中明確提到為後者（“as a share of the voting-eligible population”）。因此賓尼的推論犯下明顯錯誤，他以「投票人數佔具選民資格人口比例」乘以「選民總數」，並以為會得出「總投票人數」。由於具選民資格人數多於選民人數，所以他得出的數字應比實際投票人數少。另外，陶傑在專欄指《華盛頓郵報》「請咗專家做咗一份詳細嘅break down嘅表格，將各個州嘅選民加埋晒，就發現美國註冊嘅選民人數係超過2,100億」，所指應該為「World Population Review」整理的數據，與《華盛頓郵報》無關，並把選民人數「超過2.1億」說錯成「超過2,100億」。至於陶傑提到的「網關專家」網站相信是指網站「The Gateway Pundit」，該網站一篇報導宣稱「簡單數學顯示拜登宣稱取得票數比2020年大選中投票的合資格選民還要多1,300萬票」，內容跟陶傑專欄提及的理據相似。[9]「The Gateway Pundit」實際上只是把「World Population Review」整理的各州選民數據加起來，得出美國選民總數（如上文數據相同），再用跟賓尼相同的方法（乘以66.2%）推算，因此犯下相同錯誤。「The Gateway Pundit」宣稱拜登有1,300萬票為重複點算或偽造選票，屬錯誤推論。專門研究選舉的美國佛羅里達大學政治科學教授麥當勞（Michael P. McDonald）[10]在網站「美國選舉計劃」（United States Electoin Project）整理了更詳細的投票數據。[11]「美國選舉計劃」先以美國人口普查局2018年及2019年適齡投票人口（voting-age population）估計數據，推算出2020年11月的相關數字，然後按各州規定扣除非美國公民及因犯罪（正在服刑、緩刑或假釋者）而失去投票資格的人數，從而得出各州具選民資格人口的估計數字。他們亦從各州的官方或臨時選舉結果整理選票數字（分別有總投票人數及美國總統大選的投票人數），從而得出以「具選民資格人口數字」為基數的投票率。根據他們的計算，在總統選舉中的投票人數為約1.58億，比賓尼以錯誤方法推算出來的1.4億多出約1,800萬，而今屆美國大選具選民資格人口則約有2.39億，投票率在66.1%至66.7%之間，跟《華盛頓郵報》的數字接近。根據《Decision Desk HQ》的推算以及《維基百科》整理的各州官方網站數據[12,13]，今次美國大選中特朗普得到約7,421萬票，拜登則得到約8,127萬票，合共得票為1.55億左右，稍低於上述由「美國選舉計劃」整理的總投票人數（1.58億），未出現「投票人數少於特朗普及拜登得票總數」的情況。（更新︰關於是次大選的官方數字，可參考附錄2的整理。[a]）結論陶傑在專欄中引述賓尼的說法，指美國大選投票人數僅得1.4億，少於特朗普及拜登的總得票數，實際上混淆了兩種投票率的計算方法，從而得出錯誤結論。他又引述網絡消息指拜登得票中「多達1,300萬張係重複嘅」，此說法同樣錯誤。更新a.\n為確保引用數據可靠，Factcheck Lab從各州政府官方網站取得選舉數據再作整理，並於附錄2把結果跟上述「World Population Review」、「美國選舉計劃」及《維基百科》整理的數據對比。（更新時間︰2021-01-05 12:58）附錄1︰陶傑發言逐字稿以下為陶傑專欄的逐字稿（省略部份「呢」字以便閱讀）︰本屆嘅美國大選，民主黨集團有無作弊呢？美國國家安全局前情報官威廉·賓尼（William Binney）喺Twitter嗰度就堅持係有作弊，而且由專業角度列出一組簡單嘅數字嚟到說明。賓尼話，現在美國全國註冊選民有二億一千二百萬，咁既然今次嘅投票率係百分之六十六點二，咁算係非常之高，咁即係話呢，總共有一億四千萬人投咗票。咁喺一億四千萬人投票嚟講呢，如果Donald Trump（川普）得到七千四百萬票，咁拜登最多最多只係淨低呢六千六百萬票啫，即係相差共八百萬票咁多。而賓尼話呢個數字同而家所被告知嘅呢係完全不符合，賓尼所講嘅係根據主流媒體《華盛頓郵報》嘅數據。《華盛頓郵報》指出2020年今次嘅美國嘅選民投票率呢，係百幾年來最高，而且呢，《華盛頓郵報》裏面不但係咁講，仲有請咗專家做咗一份詳細嘅break down嘅表格，將各個州嘅選民加埋晒，就發現呢美國註冊嘅選民人數呢係超過二千一百億。咁呢一個叫「網關專家」嘅網站發現呢個數據同賓尼嘅數據非常之接近，咁即係話，如果川普贏咗七千四百萬張票，拜登呢最多最多得嗰六千七百萬張，咁即係話，多達一千三百萬張係重複嘅。重複嘅計咗畀邊個呢？當然唔會計畀Donald Trump啦，所以呢條數係好簡單，唔需要話咩電腦軟件、數學計算、統計學常識，一千三百萬選票肯定呢就係假嘅，如果《華盛頓郵報》同埋美國家情報官嘅專業權威不容質疑嘅話，所以難怪而家嘅川普總統死人都唔會放棄。附錄2︰美國大選相關數據整理本篇查核報告發佈後，Factcheck Lab透過Google搜尋美國人口普查局的人口數據、美國各州官方網站上的選舉結果及投票數據。完整試算表及資料來源見此連結。以下為簡單講述結果，並跟上述「World Population Review」、「美國選舉計劃」及《維基百科》整理的數據作對比。按美國人口普查局以2010年數據推算出來的2019年7月1日美國全國人口為3億2,948萬，全國18歲以上人口則為2億5,666萬。「美國選舉計劃」以2018年及2019年數據插值推算的2020年11月適齡投票人口（voting-age population, VAP）為2億5,761萬，兩個數字相差小於1%。而「美國選舉計劃」推算的「具選民資格人口」（voting-eligible population, VEP）——排除了非美國公民及因服刑而失去投票資格者——則為2億3,925萬。註冊選民人數方面，Factcheck Lab均使用官方數據，主要來自選民登記或投票率數據頁面，不過各州提供數據仍有差異，例如有些州份只提供活躍選民（active voters）數據，有些州份則沒有明確指出其選民數字為全部選民抑或活躍選民，此差異令各州的選民投票率有別。此外有8個州份未提供大選當日的選民登記人數，但多數均提均了11月份或11月1日的數據，只有三州例外︰堪薩斯（Kansas），非正式的7月1日數據；緬因（Maine），7月14日的活躍選民數據；田納西（Tennessee），6月選民數據。Factcheck Lab的試算表中，如有關州份提供數字為活躍選民數據，或並非投票日當日的選民數據，均會於數字所屬的儲存格中註明。根據Factcheck Lab的整理，美國全國選民人數為2億1,321萬，與上述「World Population Review」整理的數字（2億1,380萬）相差小於1%。投票人數方面，由於Factcheck Lab主要參考各州的官方大選投票數據（turnout data）頁面，如未有提供才以總統選舉總票數為準，如後者亦未有提供，則會計算各候選人的得票總和。相比之下，《維基百科》表格整理總統選舉的總票數、「美國選舉計劃」的統計則包括兩項數字，包括估計總票數（estimated total ballots）及總統選舉總票數（但當中兩州使用投票人數較多的參議員選舉）。根據Factcheck Lab的整理，是次美國大選投票人數為1億5,946萬，而《維基百科》整理的美國總統選舉投票人數為1億5,838萬，「美國選舉計劃」推算的大選總票數為1億5,969萬、總統選舉投票人數為1億5,824萬。各項數字均相差小於1%。而特朗普及拜登的得票方面，Factcheck Lab整理數據後再跟《維基百科》的表格對比，修正三項錯誤（其中兩個州份的官方網站上有不同時段的數據，以較後提供的數據為準，另一項為輸入錯誤）後，兩組數據所得結果完全相同︰特朗普得票為74,216,747，拜登得票為81,268,867。兩人總得票為155,485,614，少於上述的總票數（1.58億）。對比Factcheck Lab整理的選民數字以及「美國選舉計劃」整理的具選民資格人數，有7個州份的選民註冊率超過100%，分別為︰亞拉巴馬（Alabama），100.70%；阿拉斯加（Alaska），113.33%；特拉華（Delaware），102.64%；密芝根（Michigan），107.96%；新罕布什爾（New Hamsphire），103.69%；新澤西（New Jersey），104.03%；佛蒙特（Vermont），101.29%。以上州份提供的選民人數均未有提及是活躍選民人數，而7州以具選民資格人口計算的投票率則在63.24%至75.46%之間（全國各州數字在54.84%至79.96%之間）。其中密芝根為選情較緊湊的關鍵州份，Factcheck "

        "summary": "イベルメクチン（INN: ivermectin）は、マクロライドに分類される抗寄生虫薬である[1]。放線菌が生成するアベルメクチンの化学誘導体[1]。米メルク製造の商品名はストロメクトール、日本の販売はマルホが行う[2][3]。静岡県伊東市内のゴルフ場近くで採取した土壌から、大村智により発見された放線菌ストレプトマイセス・アベルミティリスが産生する物質を元に、米製薬メルク（MSD）が開発した[4][5]。最初の用途は、フィラリアとアカリア症を予防および治療するための動物用医薬品だった[6]。1987年にヒトへの使用が承認され[7]、現在ではアタマジラミ、疥癬、河川盲明症（オンコセルカ症）、腸管糞線虫症、鞭虫症、回虫症、リンパ系フィラリア症などの寄生虫の治療に使用されている[8][9][6][10]。標的とする寄生虫を殺すために多くのメカニズムで作用し[8]、経口投与、または外部寄生虫のために皮膚に適用できる[8][11]。ウィリアム・キャンベルと大村智は、その発見と応用で2015年ノーベル生理学・医学賞を受賞した[12]。世界保健機関（WHO）の必須医薬品リストに、腸管用駆虫薬、抗フィラリア薬、外部寄生虫感染症の治療薬として掲載されており[13]、日本では2002年に腸管糞線虫症、2006年に疥癬の内服薬として承認された[14][15]。後発医薬品が入手可能である[16][17]。2020年4月、新型コロナウイルス感染症（COVID-19）の流行初期に、in vitro（試験管内で）の研究により、高濃度のイベルメクチンが新型コロナウイルス（SARS-CoV-2）の増殖を抑制することが報告され、COVID-19の治療に応用できる可能性が示唆された[18][19][20][21]。人での有効性が未確認なため科学者や医師のほとんどは懐疑的であったが、ネット上で予防や治療に有効であるとの誤った情報が広く流布され、一般市民の間でこの薬の認知度が高まった[22][23][24][25][26][27]。そのため、イベルメクチンを処方箋なしに入手するために個人輸入する者や、抗寄生虫薬として承認された用量より多く服用（適応外使用）する者が出現し、政府や専門家による注意喚起が行われた[28][29][30][31]。その後の人を対象にした研究では、COVID-19に対するイベルメクチンの有効性を確認することはできず、2021年には、有効性を示した研究の多くに不正行為や欠陥があることが明らかになった[32][33][34][35][36]。そのため、厚生労働省、世界保健機関（WHO）、アメリカ国立衛生研究所（NIH）や欧州医薬品庁（EMA）など世界の主要な保健機関は、臨床試験以外でCOVID-19の予防・治療としてイベルメクチンを使用しないよう勧告した[37][38][39][40]。それにもかかわらず、イベルメクチンに関する誤った情報はソーシャルメディア上で広がり続け、反ワクチン主義者や陰謀論者等に支持され続けている[41][20][42][43][44][45]。歴史 [ 編集 ]1974年、微生物学者の大村智が率いる研究チームは、静岡県伊東市川奈の土壌サンプルを採取し、新しい生理活性物質の供給源として微生物の特性を評価した[12][5]。大村らは当時未知であった放線菌、ストレプトマイセス・アベルミティリスを土壌から分離・培養し、外観や培養特性が珍しいと思われる他の約50株と一緒にメルク社のウィリアム・キャンベルに送った[5][46]。北里研究所の研究者である大村は、留学先で知り合ったメルク社との間で、研究資金の提供を受ける一方、有望な微生物を見つけて提供し、メルクが薬を開発し特許を保持する権利を認め、薬が実用化された場合は売上に対する特許使用料の支払いを受ける契約を結んでいた[47][48]。アベルメクチンB 1a 、B 1b とイベルメクチンB 1a 、B 1b の部分構造比較寄生虫学を専門とするキャンベルは、メルク社のチームを率いて大村の放線菌を種々の培養液で培養し、1975年、その放線菌が産生する物質がマウスに寄生した寄生性線虫Nematospiroides dubiusに対して非常に有効であることを発見した[4]。1979年、彼らは培養物から活性化合物を単離し、化合物がマウスから虫を取り除く能力（ラテン語でa「なく」、vermis「虫」）を持つことから、それらを「アベルメクチン（Avermectin）」および放線菌をStreptomyces avermitilisと名づけ、1979年に報告した[5][49]。キャンベルのグループは、さまざまなアベルメクチンのうち、「アベルメクチンB 1 」という化合物が経口摂取した場合に最も強力であることを発見した[5]。彼らはアベルメクチンB 1 の薬物特性を改善するために改良型を合成し、最終的に少なくとも80%の22,23-ジヒドロアベルメクチンB 1a と最大20%の22,23-ジヒドロアベルメクチンB 1b の混合物を選び、その組み合わせを「イベルメクチン」と名付けた[5][50]。1981年、メルク社はイベルメクチンを動物用抗寄生虫薬として販売開始し[5]、1986年までに46カ国で使用登録され、1980年代後半にはイベルメクチンは世界で最も売れた動物用医薬品のひとつとなった[51]。ヒトのオンコセルカ症（河川盲目症）に対するイベルメクチンの安全性と有効性をテストするため、1981年、メルク社の科学者であるモハメド・アジズは、セネガルとフランスで臨床試験を実施した[7][46][52]。1982年以降、メルク社は世界保健機関（WHO）と協力し、ガーナやリベリアなど4カ国の1200人に追加試験を行い、年に1回、1錠の薬で寄生虫がほとんど駆除できることを証明した[53]。1987年、ヒトへの使用が承認され、翌年にはオンコセルカ症の撲滅に必要なイベルメクチン（薬剤名：メクチザン）の無償提供が始まった[7]。1998年にはリンパ系フィラリア症の治療に使用されるイベルメクチンにも無償提供が拡大された[7][54]。この寄付プログラムには、メルク社、世界銀行、世界保健機関（WHO）、カーターセンター、その他にも多くの機関が参加している[46]。2015年、ノーベル生理学・医学賞の半分が、アベルメクチンの発見を含む寄生虫感染症治療法の開発を評してウイリアム・キャンベルと大村智に共同で授与され、残る半分はアルテミシニン発見を含むマラリアの治療法に関する発見をした屠呦呦に贈られた[12]。作用機序 [ 編集 ]無脊椎動物のグルタミン酸作動性塩化物イオンチャネル（GluCl）に対するイベルメクチンの作用機序を示す模式図。IVM分子は、隣接するGluClサブユニットの膜貫通ドメインが形成する結合ポケットと相互作用し、チャネルを開いた状態にして、塩化物イオン（Cl-）を細胞内に無制限に通過させる（細胞膜は青とピンクのグラデーションで表現されている）イベルメクチンは、無脊椎動物の神経・筋細胞に存在するグルタミン酸作動性塩化物イオンチャネル（GluCl）に特異的かつ高い親和性を持ち結合し、塩化物イオン（Cl−）に対する細胞膜の透過性を上昇させる。これにより、Cl−が細胞内に流入するため神経細胞や筋細胞の過分極が生じ、寄生虫が麻痺を起こし死滅する[55][56][57]。動物用医薬品 [ 編集 ]ウシ・ヒツジの捻転胃虫（Haemonchus）、オステルターグ胃虫（Ostertagia）、 毛様線虫（Trichostrongylus）、クーペリア（Cooperia）、腸結節虫（Oesphagos-tomum）に対し駆虫性を有するほか、糞線虫属（Strongyloides）に感染したイヌ、ウマに対して駆虫性を有する。さらに、ウマにおける頸部糸状虫（Onchocerca cervicalis）のミクロフェラリアに対しても有効である。一方、牛用駆虫剤イベルメクチンを投与された後は、排出糞中に3週間程度検出され、ハエ（ノサシバエ、キタミドリイエバエ）の幼虫の死亡と蛹化率低下が報告されている。あわせて、畜舎周辺で捕獲されるハエ類の減少も報告されているが、ハエ類が減少しているため、糞分解活動も抑制される[58]。イヌでは、犬糸状虫症の予防のために使用される。犬糸状虫のミクロフィラリアが血中に存在しているイヌにイベルメクチンを投与すると、ミクロフィラリアが一度に死滅し、発熱やショックを引き起こす場合がある。したがって、イベルメクチンを予防薬として使用する際は、犬糸状虫の感染の有無を検査する必要がある。同効薬として、ミルベマイシン、ミルベマイシンオキシム、マデュラマイシンがある。また、スピノサドと共用したり、コリー系に使用したりすることは、ミクロフィラリアが存在しなくても、上記のことを引き起こすことがあるため、イベルメクチンは使用禁止となっている。流通肉に対する許容量 [ 編集 ]ウシの寄生虫駆除のため、イベルメクチンの投与が行われているが、牛肉に成分が残留するため、アメリカ合衆国や日本などの輸入国では、許容値が設けられている。2010年5月14日には、アメリカ合衆国農務省食品安全検査部は、ブラジル産牛肉から、許容量以上のイベルメクチンが検出されたとして輸入を停止、リコールを行った。その後、輸入は再開されたが、再び同年9月に許容量以上のイベルメクチンが検出されたとして2度目の輸入停止措置を行っている。日本では、ウマに対する一日摂取許容量として0.001mg/kg体重/日が設定されている[59]。耐性の問題 [ 編集 ]イヌ、ネコに寄生するヒゼンダニの一部に、イベルメクチンに対し薬剤抵抗性を有した事例の報告がある[60]。ウマやヒツジの生産現場では、イベルメクチンに対し薬剤耐性を持つ寄生虫が問題になっている[61][62][63]。耐性寄生虫を増やさないために、従来の全ての個体に定期的に投与してきた方法を改め、糞便中の虫卵の数から必要な個体だけに投与する方法が提唱されている[64][65]。ヒト用医薬品 [ 編集 ]日本では、腸管糞線虫症[66]、および疥癬[67][68]の治療薬として医療保険が適用され病院で処方されている[69]。腸管糞線虫症では体重1kg当たり0.2mgを2週間間隔で2回服用し[69]、疥癬では体重1kg当たり0.2mgを1回服用する（ヒゼンダニの卵は 3-5 日で孵化するが、イベルメクチンは卵に対しては効果がないため、2回投与が好ましい[70][71]。2回投与する場合は1週間空ける[69][72])。アフリカなどの熱帯地域で発生しているフィラリアの一種で、回旋糸状虫が原因であるオンコセルカ症の治療薬として、年に1 - 2回イベルメクチン150μg/kgの単回経口投与が行われている[73][74]。ミクロフィラリアは成虫になるまでに12 - 18カ月かかるため、1回の投与でミクロフィラリアを死滅させることで大幅な減少が1年以上続く[75][76]。この薬は、成虫を殺すことはできないが、メス成虫の不妊化を進め、6ヶ月ごとの投与では不妊化がより早く進む[76][77]。そのため年1 - 2回の投与で効果があり、推奨用量以上の投与は副作用の発生率が高く有害である可能性がある[76]。イベルメクチンは、冷蔵を必要とせず、服用量が少なく安全性が高いため、最小限の訓練を受けた地域の保健員によって広く投与されている[78][79]。この投与プログラムのイベルメクチンは、米製薬メルクが保健省や世界保健機関（WHO）などの非政府開発組織（NGDO）と協力し、「メクチザン寄付プログラム（MDP）」を通じて無償で提供している[79]。薬物動態 [ 編集 ]経口吸収は比較的速やかで、4-5時間で最高血中濃度に達する。皮膚への移行は内服後4-8時間後に最高に達し、その後約18時間の半減期を経て12日間以上かけて消失する[6"

        "summary": "IntroductionOver the course of a little more than a century, American liberals (or, in an earlier period, progressives) and conservatives have switched positions on judicial review, judicial restraint, and the role of the federal courts—not once, but twice.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, progressives grew increasingly skeptical of judicial review, while conservatives embraced judicial review to limit federal and state regulation and protect property rights.\nConstitutional theories—such as originalism and living constitutionalism—also evolve to reflect changing views about judicial review and judicial restraint.\nThe increasing usefulness of judicial review to the dominant party slowly causes attitudes about judicial review to shift.\nThe long-term trend of both parties investing in judicial review tempers the cycling of positions between judicial review and judicial restraint."

        "summary": "２０２１年１１月１３日土曜日・米軍はジョージW・ブッシュ前大統領を逮捕した。逮捕は、土曜日の朝にテキサス州クローフォードの牧場でブッシュを保護する民間警備会社との激しい銃撃戦の末に行われた。米軍・軍事政権はついに、２００１年ブッシュ大統領が首謀した、米国の悲劇９．１１の犯罪を裁くところに来たようである。今回は逮捕劇の模様を紹介します。引用先はREAL RAW NEWS（RRN）１１月１５日版＊ブッシュ前大統領親子の情報をWikipediaより紹介しておきます。ブッシュW４３代大統領ジョージ・ウォーカー・ブッシュ（英語： George Walker Bush[ヘルプ/ファイル]、1946年7月6日 – ）は、アメリカ合衆国の政治家。同国第43代大統領（在任: 2001年1月20日 – 2009年1月20日）、第46代テキサス州知事（在任: 1995年1月17日 – 2000年12月21日）。第41代大統領ジョージ・H・W・ブッシュは父である。またフロリダ州知事を務めたジェブ・ブッシュと実業家のニール・ブッシュは弟で、ジョージ・P・ブッシュは甥（ジェブ・ブッシュの長男）である。父子共にミドルネームは省略されて「ジョージ・ブッシュ」と呼ばれることが多い。ブッシュHW４１代大統領ジョージ・ハーバート・ウォーカー・ブッシュ[注釈 1]（英語：George Herbert Walker Bush、1924年6月12日 – 2018年11月30日）は、アメリカ合衆国の政治家。同国第41代大統領（在任：1989年1月20日 – 1993年1月20日）。テキサス州選出連邦下院議員、国際連合大使、米中連絡事務所所長、中央情報局長官（CIA長官）、副大統領を歴任した。死去時最高齢の大統領経験者であったが、2019年3月22日にジミー・カーターが最高齢記録を更新した。第43代アメリカ合衆国大統領を務めたジョージ・W・ブッシュは彼の長男である。スポンサーリンク米軍による逮捕劇・・・その作戦とは？RRNによると、米軍・特殊部隊は１１月１２日金曜日、逮捕の前日から準備は始まっていた・・・その様子を紹介（以下 RRNより 抜粋）金曜日の夜、ケンタッキー州フォートキャンベルに駐屯している特殊部隊の「アルファデタッチメント」が、米陸軍特殊作戦司令部から牧場に潜入して第43代大統領を逮捕するよう命令を受けました。 牧場に関する最近の情報は、ブッシュが定期的に敷地をパトロールしたシークレットサービスエージェントのトリオに加えて、武装した民間警備会社に囲まれていたことを示したため、SFは抵抗を期待するように言われました。 牧場への輸送は、第160特殊作戦航空連隊（ナイトストーカーと呼ばれる）によって提供されました。 ナイトストーカーは、夜間、低高度、および急な通知で輸送、攻撃、攻撃、偵察の任務を遂行する高度なスキルを持つチョッパーパイロットのグループです。 チョッパーは目的地に到着するために3回の給油停止をしなければなりませんでした。 土曜日の早朝、暗闇に覆われて、チョッパーはブッシュの1,600エーカーの牧場の南東の角近くの空き地に降りてきました。 スタッフのトレーラーやブッシュが眠っているのを見つけたいと思っていた本館から遠く離れていました。SFを降ろした後、チョッパーは夜に昇り、潜入の呼びかけを待ちました。 任務に精通している軍事筋は、特殊作戦軍が本館から100ヤード離れた通信バンカーにライブストリーミングされたトレイルカムの場所だけでなく、プロパティの詳細な衛星画像を取得したとReal RawNewsに語った。 「インテリジェンスは、ブッシュが20人の警備請負業者と3人のシークレットサービスを所有していると推定しました。 計画は、監視カメラの死角を悪用し、本館に侵入し、ブッシュの護衛を討伐し、より大きな治安部隊に警告することなく彼を追放地点に引きずり込むことでした。 しかし、何かがひどく間違っていました」と私たちの情報筋は言いました。 （引用先：軍は元大統領ジョージW.ブッシュを逮捕します）＊解説：ブッシュ陣営には２０人を超える民間警備業者が護衛している中を、牧場施設の場所の特徴を捉えた上で、監視カメラに位置を交わしながらブッシュを孤立い追い詰める作戦だった。しかし、特殊部隊の予測を裏ぎり、特殊部隊に犠牲者が出る出来事が起きた！スポンサーリンク米軍の間違いとは？逮捕に至る展開は？暗闇の中、特殊部隊がブッシュの居る施設まで２００ヤードに近づいたとき悲劇が起きました。特殊部隊に１名の犠牲者が出てしまったのである。（以下 RRN 抜粋）＊解説：暗闇の中、突然、特殊部隊の前にブッシュ側の警備がATVで現れて、ヘッドライトで特殊部隊の兵士を照らし、銃撃されてしまったと報告された。しかし、特殊部隊は反撃し、パジャマ姿のブッシュを逮捕したのである。ブッシュの罪状は、イラク・アフガンでの米兵を死に至らしめた事と９．１１の首謀者としての罪である。スポンサーリンクまとめ・・・ブッシュ前大統領逮捕された！米国イルミナティ・DS大物軍事裁判始まる！米国のDSとして、ヒラリー・クリントンに続き、ブッシュ元大統領が逮捕されたということは、ついに９．１１の犯罪が明るみになるということです。通貨発行権を維持するために、貿易センタービルに爆薬を仕掛け、バーチャルな映像を使い、アルカイダというテロ組織の犯罪に見せかけたのである。その犯罪を首謀、実行を指揮したのがブッシュなのである。その後、アフガニスタンにアルカイダを追い求め米軍を出動させて、米兵の人生を奪ったのである。その、犯罪が軍事裁判としてどのような内容になるのか？裁判でどのような証拠が暴露されるのか？裁判の行方を待ちましょう。最後までご視聴ありがとうございました。m(_ _)m＊９．１１の陰謀について詳しく知りたい方は👇の記事を視聴願います。（CG映像）（飛行機はビルに衝突していない！）"
