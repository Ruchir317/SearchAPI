  "fact": "Is it true the rumor that all Social Security beneficiaries will have to go to a location to verify their identity to receive their monthly check",
  "gemini_output": "**Verdict: False**\n\n**Collective Summary:**\nThe articles indicate that the Social Security Administration (SSA) considered changes to identity verification processes, including potentially limiting phone verification and requiring online or in-person verification for certain actions like changing bank account information. However, the SSA has since canceled the plan to end phone verification for those applying for retirement and survivor benefits. The changes were aimed at reducing fraud.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nArticle 1 directly addresses the claim and states that the rumor about all beneficiaries needing to verify in person is false, as the SSA canceled the plan. Articles 4 and 8 mention changes to verification processes, but these are related to specific actions like changing bank information or applying for benefits, not a blanket requirement for all beneficiaries to verify in person to receive their monthly checks.\n\n**Sources Summary:**\n*   **What Are the ID Verification Changes for Social Security ...:** Directly addresses and refutes the claim.\n*   **FactCheck.org - A Project of The Annenberg Public Policy Center:** Provides background on the proposed changes to identity verification.\n*   **Social Security Update | SSA:** Provides general updates about Social Security.\n*   **Correcting the Record About Social Security Direct Deposit and ...:** Explains changes to direct deposit verification, not all benefits.\n*   **Press Release | Press Office | SSA:** Provides general updates about Social Security.\n*   **Social Security's agency has announced a flurry of changes : NPR:** Discusses various changes at the SSA.\n*   **Social Security Update Archive | SSA:** Provides general updates about Social Security.\n*   **Trump administration's Social Security changes could limit access to ...:** Discusses potential limitations to access due to verification changes."
